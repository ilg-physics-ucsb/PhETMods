/**
 * A directed set of half-edges determined by how the original shapes/subpaths were directionally. This is distinct from
 * boundaries, as:
 * 1. Input shapes/subpaths can self-intersect, ignore clockwise restrictions, and avoid boundary restrictions.
 * 2. Input shapes/subpaths can repeat over the same edges multiple times (affecting winding order), and can even
 *    double-back or do other operations.
 * 3. We need to record separate shape IDs for the different loops, so we can perform CAG operations on separate ones.
 *    This means we need to track winding order separately for each ID.
 *
 * As operations simplify/remove/replace edges, it will handle replacement of the edges in the loops.
