/**
 * A trait for drawables for Circle that need to store state about what the current display is currently showing,
 * so that updates to the Circle will only be made on attributes that specifically changed (and no change will be
 * necessary for an attribute that changed back to its original/currently-displayed value). Generally, this is used
 * for DOM and SVG drawables.
 *
 * This trait assumes the PaintableStateful trait is also mixed (always the case for Circle stateful drawables).
