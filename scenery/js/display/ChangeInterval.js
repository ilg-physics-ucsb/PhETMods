/**
 * An interval (implicit consecutive sequence of drawables) that has a recorded change in-between the two ends.
 * We store the closest drawables to the interval that aren't changed, or null itself to indicate "to the end".
 *
 * isEmpty() should be used before checking the endpoints, since it could have a null-to-null state but be empty,
 * since we arrived at that state from constriction.
 *
 * For documentation purposes, an 'internal' drawable is one that is in-between (but not including) our un-changed ends
 * (drawableBefore and drawableAfter), and 'external' drawables are outside (or including) the un-changed ends.
 *
 * For stitching purposes, a ChangeInterval effectively represents two linked lists: the "old" one that was displayed
 * in the previous frame (using oldNextDrawable for iteration across the drawable linked-list), or the "new" one that
 * will be displayed in the next frame (using nextDrawable for iteration).
